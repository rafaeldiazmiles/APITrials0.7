Episode VII: The DB Awakens (fully stablished JSON communication system)


Captain's log:
Im too deep into the rabbit hole now. This seems to be my final step before getting a DB on the field. Once I know how to make an application use my API to communicate with a real DB either through JSON or PROTOB either in REST or in RPC... Ill be ready to deploy. 

We are running far behind... but we ARE running, we ARE on our feet. We WILL reach that DB - App connection, and then... who will stop us then?
